talks
=====

People have been so foolish to let me talk in public a few times.

Slides with a .slide file extension are made with the [Go present tool](http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/present). You can take a look at them via talks.godoc.org (e.g. [talks.godoc.org/github.com/tcard/talks/2014/desarrollo-web.slide](http://talks.godoc.org/github.com/tcard/talks/2014/desarrollo-web.slide) or download and run them yourself (some code examples will work only this way).
